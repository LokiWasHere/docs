title: Versionning
---

When we make backwards-incompatible changes to the API, we release new versions. The latest released version is `v1`.

To use a specific version of the API, make sure to update the `version` in the API url.

## Backwards compatible changes

We do NOT consider the following types of changes to be breaking changes.

- Adding new API resources, paths, and methods.

- Adding new optional request parameters or headers to existing APIs.

- Expanding acceptable values for an exisitng request parameter or header.

- Adding new attributes to existing API responses.

- Expanding or collapsing possible values for an attribute in existing API responses.

  - **⚠️ WARNING:** Your implementation should gracefully handle unknown values. You should NOT expect string attributes to be a static enumeration.

- Adding new items in array attribute values.

- Reordering of items in array attribute values.

- Chaning the order of properties in existing API responses.

- Changing the length or format of opaque strings, such as object IDs, error messages, and other human-readble strings.

- New validations or restrictions added to protect our systems from bad behavior, such as rate limits or restrictions against malicious input in requests.

## Breaking changes

We consider the following types of changes to be backwards-incompatible. When we make these changes, we release a new version of the API. You're in charge of when you get breaking changes—you get them when you upgrade your API version.

- Removing or renaming an existing API.

- Removing or renaming existing request parameters or headers.

- Removing support for a previously acceptable request parameter or header value.

- Adding a new required request parameter or header value to an existing API.

- Adding validations or restrictions that would cause previously valid requests to be considered invalid.

- Removing or renaming an attribute in existing API responses.

- Changing the type of an attribute in existing API responses.

- Changing the status code for a particular scenario (except when the existing status code is 404 or 5xx).

- Changing the semantics of a value for an existing request parameter, header, or attribute in existing API responses.
