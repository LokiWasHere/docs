The CCCAMBOX TV API uses `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests to communicate and HTTP response codes to indicate status and errors. All responses come in standard `JSON`. HTTP and HTTPS with TLS versions below 1.1 are not supported. Requests should typically include a Content-Type of `application/json` and the body must be valid `JSON`.
