## API Reference

The CCCambox Reseller API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded request bodies](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms>), returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

You can use the CCCAMBOX Reseller API in test mode, which doesnâ€™t affect your live data. The API key you use to [authenticate](/documentation/authentification) the request determines whether the request is live mode or test mode.
