To access the CCCAMBOX TV Reseller API, you will need an API key. You can view and manage your API keys in the [dashboard](https://web.hidden.com/dashboard).

<Warning>
  It is important to keep your API keys secure. Treat them as sensitive
  information and do not share them in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub
  or client-side code. This helps prevent unauthorized access to your account
  and protects your data.
</Warning>
