## Request example

You can paste the command below into your terminal to run your first API request. Make sure to replace $CCCAMBOX TV_API_KEY with your [secret API key](/documentation/authentification).

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.reselliptv.com/v1/public/credits \
  --header 'x-api-key: $CCCAMBOX TV_API_KEY'
```

This request queries your actual account balance of credits. You should receive a response that looks like this:

```json
{
  "credits": 1000
}
```

Congratulations! You have successfully made your first API request using cURL. Now you can continue exploring the API and building more advanced requests to interact with the CCCAMBOX TV service.
