Title: Error Handling
---

Our API responses use standard HTTP status codes: `2xx` status codes indicate success, `4xx` status codes indicate invalid input or invalid action on current state, and `5xx` status codes indicate a rare error on CCCAMBOX TV's servers.

## Error handling

Errors that you will receive from CCCAMBOX TV fall into two major categories:

- **Client errors:** Invalid content in the API request.
- **Server errors:** A problem on CCCAMBOX TV's server.

A list of all error codes is provided at the of this page.

### Client errors

Client errors result from invalid content of an API request. They return an HTTP response with a `4xx` error code. For example, the server may return a `401` if you provide an invalid API key, or a `422` if invalid parameters were provided. For client errors, we generally recommend correcting the original request and trying again.

There are caveats to the above. For example, if you receive a `429` error due to your request being rate limited, subsequent requests with the same idempotency key will still run because rate limiters are executed before the API's idempotency layer. Similarly, the same goes for a `401` due to an invalid API key.

### Server errors

Server errors result from a problem with CCCAMBOX TV's servers. They return an HTTP response with a `5xx` error code. These errors are the most difficult to handle and the CCCAMBOX TV team tries our best to ensure they occur as rarely as possible. The most likely time to observe a server error is during a production incident. You should treat the result of a server error as indeterminate.

For server errors, we recommend retrying with new requests if it is safe for your use case. In addition, we recommend leveraging `requestId` and Accounts to properly group requests to make it easy to track objects that were re-created.

## Error codes

When an erorr is encountered, the response body contains a list of errors with title and details.

```json
{
  "code": "request_errors",
  "data": {
    "errors": [
      {
        "code": "<string>",
        "message": "<string>",
        "path": ["<string>"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Below is a list of possible error codes with their meanings.

| HTTP Status Code                   | Description                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 400 - Bad Request                  | The request was unacceptable, often due to invalid parameters.                                               |
| 401 - Unauthorized                 | An invalid API key was provided.                                                                             |
| 402 - Payment Required             | The requested action requires a payment. Your organization's balance is insufficient to perform this action. |
| 404 - Not Found                    | The requested resource doesn't exist.                                                                        |
| 409 - Conflict                     | The request conflicts with another request, often due to attempting to create a duplicate resource.          |
| 429 - Too Many Requests            | Your organization's rate limit has been exceeded. We recommend an exponential backoff on requests.           |
| 500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors | Something went wrong on CCCAMBOX TV's end. These are rare.                                                      |
