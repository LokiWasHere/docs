## How to use the API Key

The CCCambox Reseller API uses API keys to authenticate requests. To generate an API Key, please refer to [API Keys page](/doc/api-keys).

All API requests should include your API key in an `x-api-key` HTTP header as follows, replacing `$CCCAMBOX_API_KEY` with your actual key:

```
x-api-key: $CCCAMBOX_API_KEY
```

All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
